# Class Notes (Data)

Almost everything (directories) in this repository should go inside `pb_public` folder.

This works by assuming your pocketbase installation's data is at: `/home/ubuntu/apps/class-notes/pb`, where the username is `ubuntu`, and the destination directory `pb_public`. Note that everything inside this folder will be deleted and replaced.

### Run the script

Make the script executable:

```
chmod +x copy_files.sh
```

Execute the script:

```
./copy_files.sh
```

### DO NOT EDIT THE FILES INSIDE `pb_public`!!!
